    <h1>Breaking Bad</h1>
    <img src="./index_images/breaking_bad.jpeg" alt>
    <p>I would like to remake the <a href="http://www.savewalterwhite.com/" target="save_walter_white_website">save Walter White website</a> from my favorite show breaking bad.</p>
    <p>I know the website is not that big, but i think it would be cool to add more things like secret/hidden links to other pages.</p>
    <p>For some background information here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad" target="breaking_bad_info">Wiki link about Breaking Bad</a></p>
    <p>During the show his son creates a fundraiser website to raise some money for medical bills, but Walter White uses this website to money launder some of his dirty money with fake accounts that donates to the website.</p>
    <p>Some ideals I have in mind are to create fake notifications showing that people are donating, also maybe some hidden links on the website that traces back to Walter White criminal activities.</p>
